# Life Formulas I

- These are notes to myself. Your frame of reference, and therefore your calculations, may vary. These are not definitions â€“ these are algorithms for success. Contributions welcome.
- Happiness = Health + Wealth + Good Relationships
- Health = Exercise + Diet + Sleep 
- Exercise = High Intensity Resistance Training + Sports + Rest
- Diet = Natural Foods + Intermittent Fasting + Plants
- Sleep = No alarms +  8-9 hours + Circadian Rhythms
- Wealth = Income + Wealth * (Return on Investment) 
- Income = Accountability + Leverage + Specific Knowledge
- Accountability = Personal Branding + Personal Platform + Taking Risk?
- Leverage = Capital + People + Intellectual Property
- Specific Knowledge = Knowing how to do something that society cannot yet easily train other people to do  
- RoI = Buy-and-Hold + Valuation + Margin of Safety
